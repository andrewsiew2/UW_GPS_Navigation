Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I did a complete change of my ADT which uses a HashMap with Strings as Keys and A list of Edges as Values. This is because
using my previous implementation took about 10 mins to construct the graph and there were a lot of unnecessary methods
to make it work. This also made it easier for me to write code to find the shortest paths between two nodes.

I changed my Node class to and Edge class. This is because the node class only contained a single field which would be
the same as using a String so I used an Edge class to contain more information.
