# Test if a node can point to itself twice

# Create a graph
created graph graphWithANode

# Add a pair of nodes
added node NodeA to graphWithANode

# Add an edge
added edge labelA from NodeA to NodeA in graphWithANode
added edge labelB from NodeA to NodeA in graphWithANode

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges 
graphWithANode contains: NodeA 
the children of NodeA in graphWithANode are: NodeA(labelA) NodeA(labelB)
