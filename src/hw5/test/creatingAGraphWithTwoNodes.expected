# Test if two nodes can be created in a graph

# Create a graph
created graph graphWithTwoNodes

# Add a pair of nodes
added node NodeA to graphWithTwoNodes
added node NodeB to graphWithTwoNodes

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges 
graphWithTwoNodes contains: NodeA NodeB
the children of NodeA in graphWithTwoNodes are:
the children of NodeB in graphWithTwoNodes are:
