# Test if two nodes can be created in a graph with edges

# Create a graph
created graph graphWithTwoNodes

# Add a pair of nodes
added node NodeA to graphWithTwoNodes
added node NodeB to graphWithTwoNodes

# Add an edge
added edge labelA from NodeA to NodeB in graphWithTwoNodes
added edge labelB from NodeB to NodeA in graphWithTwoNodes

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges 
graphWithTwoNodes contains: NodeA NodeB
the children of NodeA in graphWithTwoNodes are: NodeB(labelA)
the children of NodeB in graphWithTwoNodes are: NodeA(labelB)
