# UW GPS Navigation tool

This is the coursework done for a software implementation class at the University of Washington. Generics and good software implementation techniques such as testing were used.

## Summary
The hw5 folder contains the data structures needed for the graph.

The hw6 folder contains the a parser that tests the graph structure made in hw5 with input data of Marvel characters.

The hw7 folder contains a parser which is an extension of the parser in hw6 which uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.

The hw8 folder contains the model, view and controller of the program. The model consists of the classes that represent data, as well as the classes that load, store, look up, or operate on data. The view implements the user interface. The controller handles user input.

The hw9 folder contains the GUI that was implemented with java swing.

## Running the application
```git
cd hw9
ant build
cd ../..
java -cp bin hw9.CampusPathsMain
```
